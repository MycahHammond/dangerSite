				I have a playlist titled: "Obsessed" in my YouTube Music account. Back in the day of Google Play Music, one could see how many times they had listened to a particular track. (One of the many features removed after forcing the paying customer to migrate and then raising prices while trying to insist that they be interested in the lates popragemumble garbage. But I digress)

				A song would only be added to the list once I had seen that it had been listened too &gt=100 times. When doing deep work I have the habit of looping a single song. Typically for hours on end. Some shorter songs would make the cut in a single day. <span><a href="https://youtu.be/o8g5Omp0Tas" target="_blank">Small Memory by Jon Hopkins</a> made it in a single sitting. </span>

				The interesting thing it wasn't a playlist I would ever shuffle, or just play. It was more of a staging area for songs I new could be thrown on a loop without risking getting lost wondering through my library instead of working on the task at hand. Then one day a friend saw the lable, "Obsessed" and decided to put it on. I don't recall the exact order of what came on, there are 217 songs on the list currently. But it went something like this:

					It was at that point that said friend paused and asked what's wrong with me. Given the fact that I hadn't not looped these songs in recent memory, I think I was more mentally disturbed by the experience. Kept feeling like I should've been working on something. I'll finish this later.
