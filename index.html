	<h1>Slow the Curry</h1>

		<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
			I <em>love</em> video games. I am also a work-a-holic. After an especially difficult bout of undending work, my lovely wife prescribed me an evening of gaming with one of my best friends. During the course of that evening we discovered the combination of slow motion and curry modes on Super Smash Brothers Brawl. This led to the first five minute span in then-recent memory some portion of my mind wasn't occupied with looping through a never ending TODO list. Thus Slow the Curry was born as a way to trick my work-a-holic self into playing a bit more. Doing things that may or may not have a career/monetary benefit, but that I find interesting and enjoyable. Things like this, learning HTML. Possibly a marketable skill, not something I'm likely to "focus" on for that purpose. But I will learn enough to be dangerous, and do things I find interesting.
